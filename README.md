# Calculator
Calculator using HTML CSS and JS I was given a school assignment to make a calculator where I use HTML CSS JS. 
Since I am new to JS, I wanted to follow a simple tutorial with a good explanation of thinking and structure. 
With a lot of searching (strangely enough) I found one! This one helped me alot.

I will post my own css style later I don't think it looks so awesome right now hehe.

Hope you enjoy!
